## My process
  i started out this challenge by writing down the required html elements and tags accordingly for a mobile first approach. paying attention to details. afterwards i had to implement it. set out tthe structure for the project and styled it carefully. finally , i had to understand the problem before writing down the javascript function for the code.
### Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
CSS Grid
Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most important thing i learnt in this project which i want to identify first is that querySelectorAll returns a NodeList, not an element. So you can't add event listener to it directly. which made me use a foreach loop to iterate through the array. also i had to think carefully in picking my style values. and i realized if i was to do this project again another time i won't have the exact same value. 
i built this project using mobile first approach which helped me understand how to use media queries better. 
and many more.

### Continued development

i want to continue build complex projects using mobile first approach and modern javascript syntax.



### Useful resources

google and stackoverflow helped me when my querryselectorAll didn't work.
